Introduction
The project is an Employee Management System built using an AVL Tree, which is a self-balancing binary search tree. This system allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of employee data, which includes employee ID, name, age, and department. The project includes features such as adding, searching, deleting, and displaying employees, with each operation performed on an AVL tree to ensure balanced and efficient operations.

Problem Domain
The main problem the system addresses is the efficient management of employee data, especially when dealing with large numbers of employees. Without an optimized data structure, operations like searching for an employee, adding a new employee, and deleting employees could become slow as the size of the dataset increases. Traditional data structures like arrays or linked lists are inefficient for such tasks due to their linear time complexity in search and insertion operations.

The challenges include:

Efficient Search: Searching for an employee by employee ID in a large dataset can be slow with an unoptimized data structure.
Efficient Insertion and Deletion: When employees are added or removed, the system needs to maintain efficient organization to allow for fast searches and consistent performance.
Scalability: As the number of employees grows, the system should maintain optimal performance, ensuring that all operations (search, insert, delete) remain efficient.
Solution Domain
The solution is implemented using an AVL Tree (a self-balancing binary search tree). The AVL tree is ideal for this scenario as it guarantees that the height of the tree remains balanced after each insertion or deletion operation. This ensures that the operations on the tree (search, insert, delete) are completed in O(log n) time, where n is the number of employees in the system. The main features of the solution are:

Insert Employee: Adds an employee while maintaining the balanced structure of the AVL tree.
Search Employee: Finds an employee by their ID in O(log n) time.
Delete Employee: Removes an employee from the tree and maintains balance.
Inorder Traversal: Displays all employees in a sorted manner by their ID, which makes it easy to view employee information.
Software Used
Programming Language: Python 3
Data Structures: AVL Tree, Binary Search Tree (BST), Linked List (for tree nodes)
IDE/Editor: Any text editor or IDE such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Sublime Text.
Operating System: Windows, Linux, or macOS (dependent on the user's environment)
Libraries/Tools: Standard Python libraries (no external libraries are required for the AVL tree implementation)
Data Structure Used
AVL Tree:

An AVL Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. It ensures that the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. If the tree becomes unbalanced, rotations (left or right) are performed to restore balance.
Rotations in AVL Trees:
Right Rotation: Performed when the left subtree is taller.
Left Rotation: Performed when the right subtree is taller.
Left-Right and Right-Left Rotations: These are double rotations that occur in more complex cases of imbalance.
Node Structure:

Each node of the AVL tree contains:
emp_id: Employee ID (used for sorting employees).
name: Employee name.
age: Employee age.
department: Employee department.
left: Left child node.
right: Right child node.
height: Height of the node, used for balancing calculations.
Methodology
The methodology employed in this project follows the basic structure of implementing an AVL Tree and utilizing it for managing employee data. The steps are as follows:

Data Representation:
Each employee is represented as an instance of the Employee class, which contains the employee's ID, name, age, and department.
AVL Tree Structure:
An AVLTree class is created to manage the operations. It contains methods for insertion, deletion, and searching of employees, as well as methods for balancing the tree (rotations).
Insertion:
Insertion is done similarly to that of a regular Binary Search Tree (BST). However, after every insertion, the height of each node is updated, and the balance factor is checked. If the tree becomes unbalanced, appropriate rotations are performed to restore balance.
Searching:
Searching is done by comparing the employee ID with the current node’s ID, following the left or right child depending on the comparison, until the employee is found or the end of the tree is reached.
Deletion:
Deletion of an employee is done by finding the employee and removing the node. If the node has two children, the inorder successor is used to replace it. After deletion, the tree is rebalanced using rotations if necessary.
Traversal:
An inorder traversal is used to display all employees sorted by their employee ID. This ensures that the employee list is always ordered when displayed.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of an AVL Tree for efficient employee data management. The balanced nature of the AVL tree ensures that all operations—insertions, deletions, and searches—are performed in optimal time complexity. The employee management system provides a scalable solution to handle employee records efficiently, and the project can be extended further with additional features like updating employee details or exporting records.
